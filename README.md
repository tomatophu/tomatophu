# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My (user)name is Tomatofu. I enjoy programming in Python, especially using the Pygame-CE module.

Here's what I'm working on:
 - Cookiedough, a game utilizing Pygame-CE which is based off of the well-known game Cookie Clicker.
 - Drought, a raycaster-game utilizing Pygame-CE. I have no idea what the game is about, I just thought that "Drought" was a cool name.
